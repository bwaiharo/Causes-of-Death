## About The Project
There are many ways to die based on many factors such as age, race, etc. Using health data from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and NYC Open Data it enables us to categorize these factors and to create visualizations based on the analysis of our data. These visualizations provide estimates on how people die due to each cause or factor. 
### Built With
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)
* [D3](https://d3js.org/)
* [JS](https://jscharting.com/)
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
## Getting Started(Process)
Pull data from sources ( api,web scraping, csv etc)
Analyze data and clean the data, in Jupyter Notebook to be uploaded in database.
Create a database in Mongo DB
Create flask to pull data for database
Manipulate the data to create the different visualizations.
We use Plotly, D3 and  Leaflet to create the graphs
Create Dashboard using bootstrap features

pip install mongodb
pip install Flask
*pip install other dependencies if needed
