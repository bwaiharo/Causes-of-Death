## About The Project
There are many ways to die based on my many factors such as age, race, etc. Using health data from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that helps categorize these factors we are able to analyze the data to form visualizations. These visualizations provide estimates on how people die due to each cause or factor. 
### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
